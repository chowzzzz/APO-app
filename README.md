### APO PWA Application - _Singapore Polytechinic (Diploma in Business IT) Year 3 Final Year Project_ :woman_student: :man_student:

An application built for our Final Year Project client, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) :police_officer:. This application was built to digitise their manual 
record-inspection process of Auxiliary Police Officers (APO) and Aviation Security Officers (ASO), as well as to give them real-time access to their database. 
As it is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), it acts as both a web application and a mobile application.
